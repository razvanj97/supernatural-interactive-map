# supernatural-interactive-map

The project was done in April of 2018. 

A 3 days individual project where our task was to design an interactive map using the Mapbox API. 

The concept was simple. Chose our favorite film or TV show and use the map to tell their story.

Unfortunately at the time, I wasn't able to figure out some bugs with it.
